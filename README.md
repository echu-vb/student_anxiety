# Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Anxiety Levels Found in Statistic Classes (Python/ R)
Data from: [a survey conducted at Dalhousie University that asked students their demographics and various questions to gauge their anxiety in different areas.](https://osf.io/nzhq6/files/osfstorage)
***
## Findings: 
Through the use of a two way ANOVA test, I found that the variation of test anxiety in statistics classes could be explained with program type (undergraduate, graduate). 
By utilizing linear regression, I tried to create a model to predict test anxiety and willingness to ask for help given the variables provided from the survey (self-efficacy, anxiety sensitivity, perfectionism) but was unable to create one with significant accuracy.
