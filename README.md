# Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Anxiety Levels Found in Statistic Classes (Python/ R)
Data from: [a survey conducted at Dalhousie University that asked students their demographics and various questions to gauge their anxiety in different areas.](https://osf.io/nzhq6/files/osfstorage)

## Question 1: Does statistics anxiety differ by faculty (arts, science, other, and program level (undergrad vs grad)?
Through the use of a two way ANOVA test, I found that the variation of test anxiety in statistics classes could be explained with program type (undergraduate, graduate). 
Program type for level of test anxiety had a large F statistic (19.839) as well as a very low p-value (1.07e-05) indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis (there is no significant difference between the means of the undergraduate/graduate)

We can attribute undergraduate students having a higher mean test anxiety to the likelihood of graduate students being better students and thus feeling less anxious for tests.

Faculty did not have a high F statistic (4.467) but had a p-value low enough to be statistically significant (0.012)
